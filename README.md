Task scheduling app based on the claim that a reverse spaced-repetition schedule works well for learners and procrastinators.

The end goal is to maximise efficiency of panic and stress based engineering hours, while harnessing the creative output of an early start.

Because one is most efficient at implementation tasks during pre-deadline panic, we schedule the implementation, the major block of hours, very close to the deadline.
You start early, get your brain a chance ot think about things, by scheduling sessions for the project at closer and closer intervals as the deadline approaches.

Given a user-story/sprit/task with a (soft) deadline `x` units away, and with it being split into `s` sessions to make `x/s` number of events to schedule.
